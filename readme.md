# Tic Tac Toe

A simple game of tic-tac-toe. This was more for my own sanity; as I was wondering if I could complete it in one sitting (took about 3.5-4 
hours) to get a fully working basic version.

## Future Features

In no particular order, these are the features I still would like to get in:

* A toggle for new Game to manually flip the player instead of making it random
* AI support with difficulty setting
* More styling to give it a bit more flair
* Mobile support
